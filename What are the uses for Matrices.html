  <h2>Uses of Matrices</h2>
  <p><strong>Uses of Matrices in Mathematics</strong><br>
    Uses of matrices in maths have a history of solving the linear equations. Matrices are incredibly useful things that occur in various applied areas. Uses of matrices in mathematics applies to different branches of science, also as different
    mathematical disciplines.<br>

    <strong>Uses of Matrices in Graphics</strong><br>
    When it comes to the uses of matrices in graphics, digital image is said to be matrix. In simpler terms – the rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the rows and columns of pixels.
    And the numerical entries correspond to the pixels’ color codes. In addition, matrices are also used to represent graphs. Meaning, every graph can be represented as a matrix, each column and each row of a matrix is a point of network and the
    value of their intersection, is the connection they have.<br>

  <h2>Applications of Matrices</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Encryption</strong><br>
    A very common use of matrix in daily life is encryption. We use it to scramble data for security purposes, and to encode and decode this data, we require matrices. There is a key that helps encode and decode data which is generated by
    matrices.<br>
    <strong>3D Games</strong><br>
    One application of matrices is in games. We use it to alter the object, in 3d space. They use the 3d matrix to 2d matrix to convert it into the different objects as per requirement.<br>
    <strong>Geology</strong><br>
    Matrices are used for taking seismic surveys.<br>
    <strong>Physics</strong><br>
    Matrices are applied in the study of quantum mechanics, electrical circuits, and optics. It helps in the calculation of battery power outputs, resistor conversion of electrical energy into another useful energy. Therefore, matrices play a major
    role in calculations. Especially in solving the problems using Kirchoff’s laws of voltage and current.<br>
    <strong>Animation</strong><br>
    It can help make animations more precise and accurate.<br>
